# WinPIT
---

Windows Process Injection Toolkit aka WinPIT, is a tool that was
concieved in order to truly have a broad spectre of options regarding
process injection at any architecture thats possible to actually
inject into.

I will not ever include any detailed information towards each feature
that the tool holds - wether it be the actual internal code, or the
GUI accessible functions. It is a pretty simple straight-outta-the-box
tool, so if you are not able to use it - maybe you shouldn't even have
it - that simple!

There are a few limitations towards who may be able to run this tool;

### 1:
```
   User SHOULD use a multi-core CPU:
   * Because code is and/or will use multi-threading...
```
### 2:
```
   User MUST run a modern version of Windows:
   * The tool is built on Windows 10 (Updated to latest in July 2018)...
   * The tool will never ever have any direct support for such OS as
     Windows Vista (I do not support such shitty OS!) or Windows Pre-XP!
```
### 3:
```
   User MUST be aware that there is NO warranties in using this tool,
   some of the methods involved in this tool may actually cause harm
   if not used properly:
   * Some of the methods may contain code that will break your OS' internal
     kernel code into crashing with a known BSOD...
   * Some of the methods may contain code that will be seen as a virus by
     all known standards (I'm referring to elevation escalation and such)...
```

Credits are due where credits are due, no greets and no regrets!
